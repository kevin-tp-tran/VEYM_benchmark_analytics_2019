# VEYM 2019 Benchmark Analytics
The Vietnamese Eucharistic Youth Movement is a non-profit organization focusing on developing the youth to become better members of society and becoming saints in their everyday lives. The organization has multiple chapters across the world and there are over 100 chapters within the United States.

During the 2017-2018 year, the benchmark team launched its first pilot benchmark test. With great success, the benchmark test continued into the next academic year.

Following the examination period, we accumulated data from across the United States and are conducting the data analysis and visualization.

Within, you will find these things:
* Data depicting the test responses, scores, and answers
* Code to make visualizations and analysis
* Visualizations of the data
