# VEYM 2019 Benchmark Analytics
The Vietnamese Eucharistic Youth Movement is a non-profit Catholic organization focusing on developing the youth to become better members of society and becoming saints in their everyday lives. The organization has 144 chapters around the nation that are split into league of chapters. These league of chapters then report to the national headquarters located in California. 

During the 2017-2018 year, the benchmark team launched its first pilot benchmark test. With great success, the benchmark test continued into the next academic year (2018-19). Following the examination period, the benchmark team accumulated data from across the United States and are investigating this data to use machine learning to build visualizations and answer various questions using hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.

Altogether, there were 11 benchmark tests distributed out:
1) AN Cap I (Ages 7-8)
2) AN Cap II (Ages 8-9)
3) AN Cap III (Ages 9-10)
4) TN Cap I (Ages 10-11)
5) TN Cap II (Ages 11-12)
6) TN Cap III (Ages 12-13)
7) NS Cap I (Ages 13-14)
8) NS Cap II (Ages 14-15)
9) NS Cap III (Ages 15-16)
10) HS Cap I (Ages 16-17)
11) HS Cap II (Ages 17-18)

Within this repository, you will find these files:
* Data depicting the test responses, scores, and answers in the form of Excel files
* Code to make visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, Q-Q plots, and other visualization tools using R code.
* Visualizations of the data split up by league of chapters followed by invidiual chapters. Within the chapter folders, there are two documents, one .pdf file of all of the visualizations and one .doc file stating the conclusions/main data values we can make from the visualizations. There is one .pdf and .doc file per test.
