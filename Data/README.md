## VEYM Benchmark Data 2019
# Individual Test Data
Within the non-profit organization, the youth are divided up into four different divisions. These include:
* Seedling Division(AN) ranging from ages 6-9
* Search Division (TN) ranging from ages 10-12
* Companion Division (NS) - ranging from ages 13-15
* Eucharistic Knight Division (HS) - ranging from 16-17

All of these divisions have different a range of ages, and each age group had their own test (specified as C1, C2, C3).

For each of the tests, we had data depicting their responses to questions, their scores based off of the responses, what topic each question was intended to cover, and the answer keys to do our analysis.

These documents were labeled as (Division).(group [C1, C2, C3]).(numbers, letters, or answers) within the separate folders.

# Chapter Data
