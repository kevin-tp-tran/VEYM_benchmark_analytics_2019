# VEYM Benchmark Data 2019
## Individual Test Data
For each of the tests, we had data depicting their responses to questions, their scores based off of the responses, what topic each question was intended to cover, and the answer keys to do our analysis.

These documents were labeled as (Division).(group [C1, C2, C3]).(numbers, letters, or answers) within the separate folders.

## Chapter Data
All of the students took the test at one chapter. The chapters and their locations are located within the List of Leagues and Chapters within the Location.xlsx document.

## Topic Breakdown
The topic breakdown for each of the questions can be found in the Topic Breakdown.xlsx

For all of the different tests, the objectives were different depending on the age group. However, the main overarching topics are:
* Weekly Gospel knowledge
* Eucharist meaning
* Phong Trao (history, skills, and general knowledge about the organization)
* Specialty
* Formation
* Songs
* Religious Life
