The mean = the average test score
Median = the middle value of the numbers
2 standard deviations on both ends = 95% 
Standard deviation = spread
1st quartile = "About 25% of students had test scores below ______"
Median = "About 50% of students had test scores below _______"
3rd Quartile = "About 75% of students had test scores below 

Why do we care about normal distribution?
If the distribution is similar to a normal distribution we can conclude data similarly to a normal distribution
Less than one standard deviation from the mean = 68%, less than two standard deviation from the mean = 95%
99.7% is three standard deviations
