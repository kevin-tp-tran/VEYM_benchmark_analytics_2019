# How to Read Visualizations
1) The first graph depicts a histogram of all the scores for the test with a red line at the mean percentage.
2) The second graph depicts a boxplot of all the scores with outliers indicated as dots.
3) The following 6 graphs and boxplots indicate the scores for the categories within the test.
4)The next graphs (amount depending on the number of questions) are each question breakdown and the responses.
 * X means that no answer was given
 * O means that there was another answer given aside from A, B, C, D, E, or X
 * Green indicates the answer for the question (for some questions, you may not see green because there were barely any students who answered correctly).
5)The barplot of question correct percentages look at every individual question, calculates the percentage of students who got it correct, and plots that onto this bar plot.
6) The plot of question correct percentages graph the question number versus the percentage of students correct for the given question.
* Disregard the (0,0) point as there is no question number 0.
